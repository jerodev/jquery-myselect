# jQuery myselect

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jerodev/jquery-myselect.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jerodev/jquery-myselect)

This is yet another jQuery multiselect library. The difference with other libraries 
is that this one was made with customization in mind. I tried to make this library
as small and simple as possible.

## Examples

Examples of this multiselect can be found on [the documentation website](https://jerodev.github.io/jquery-myselect/).
