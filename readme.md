# jQuery myselect

This is yet another jQuery multiselect library. The difference with other libraries 
is that this one was made with customization in mind. I tried to make this library
as small and simple as possible.

## Examples

Examples of this multiselect can be found on [the documentationwebsite](https://jerodev.github.io/jquery-myselect/).
